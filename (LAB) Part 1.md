# Lab 1-1
This lab uses the files Lab01-01.exe and Lab01-01.dll. Use the tools and techniques described in the chapter to gain information about the files and answer the questions below.
## Questions
1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
		*Lab01-01.exe: Yes (sha256: 58898bd42c5bd3bf9b1389f0eee5b39cd59180e8370eb9ea838a0b327bd6fe47)*
		*Lab01-01.dll: Yes (sha256: f50e42c8dfaab649bde0398867e930b86c2a599e8db83b8260393082268f2dba)*
2. When were these files compiled?
		*Open the files in PEview (In my case, I used pestudio and it still worked fine)*
		*Lab01-01.exe: Sun Dec 19 16:16:19 2010 (UTC)*
		*Lab01-01.dll: Sun Dec 19 16:16:38 2010 (UTC)*
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
		*Open the files with PEiD*
		*Lab01-01.exe: PEiD didn't detect a packer*
		*Lab01-01.dll: PEiD didn't detect a packer*
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
		*Use Dependency Walker to check for imports. Dependency Walker was giving me some errors so I used the newer Dependencies program instead*
		*In the program, double click the file you loaded on the top left corner to see its imports*
		*Lab01-01.exe:*
		- Sleep
		- CreateProcessA
		- CreateMutexA
		- CloseHandle
		The dll also takes imports from WS2_32.dll, which provides network functionality
		*Lab01-01.dll:*
		- CloseHandle
		- UnmapViewOfFile
		- IsBadReadPtr
		- MapViewOfFile
		- CreateFileMappingA
		- CreateFileA
		- FindClose
		- FindNextFileA
		- FindFirstFileA
		- CopyFileA
		This program seems to search for and create files.
		**According to the textbook, CreateProcess and Sleep are common imports for backdoors.**
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
		*Read the strings in the files using pestudio or just the strings command*
		*Lab01-01.exe: There are strings containing ".text" and ".exe" in this PE, so it probably searches the system for files with that extension. Also, there's a string with "kerne123.dll". So maybe this malware is trying to replace the legit kernel32.dll file with this? That might be an indicator.*
		*Lab01-01.dll: There's an IP address (127.26.152.13) in the file strings. Another interesting string is "exec". Also the word "hello" for some reason*
		**According to the textbook, CreateProcess can be used with exec in order to send commands through the backdoor to run a program. Sleep can be used to tell the backdoor to sleep for stealth.**
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
		*The IP address mentioned earlier in Lab01-01.dll*
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?
		*The .exe file seems to search for and replace kernel32.dll for a malicious version. The .dll seems to be a backdoor.*

# Lab 1-2
