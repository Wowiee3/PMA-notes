These notes were written in Obsidian. Some Obsidian links may not work in the md files. 
I highly don't recommend cloning this repo and importing it as your own Obsidian vault. My obsidian config file got cloned as well (I'm too lazy to remove it), and I have vim mode enabled.
If you want to clone it and import it into your own Obsidian, pls delete the .obsidian file.
