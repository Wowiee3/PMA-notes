## 1.1 | Basic Static Techniques
#### Packed and Obfuscated
- Detect packers with PEiD program

#### Linked Libraries and Functions
##### Static Linking
Common in UNIX and Linux. Static linking makes it so that all code from the library is copied to the executable, making it bigger. 
This also makes it harder to differentiate between statically linked code and the original code. <- Nothing in the PE header indicates that it contains linked code either. 

##### Runtime Linking
Common in malware, esp packed or obfuscated. Executables only connect to libraries when a function is needed, not at program start. (unlike dynamic linking).
This means that when the functions are used, you can't what functions they are through static analysis.

*Windows has some functions that allow importing libraries not listed in a program's file header.*
- `LoadLibrary` 
- `GetProcAddress`
- `LdrGetProcAddress`
- `LdrLoadDll`

##### Dynamic Linking
Most common linking method. When the program is loaded, the host OS searched for the necessary libraries. 
When the calls a function from a library, the function executes within the library.
In this case, the PE header will store information about the loaded libraries.

**Dependency Walker Tool**
Can be used to explore dynamically linked functions.
The tool can be used to list out the DLLS being imported into the program. Clicking on a DLL will show its imported functions (the panel on the top). The panel at the bottom will show the functions that can be imported (but aren't used in this program). Also in these two windows, there are columns titled [[Ordinals]]. Some times malware imports functions by ordinal.
The remaining two panel display additional information about the DLLs and any reported errors. 

##### Commonly used DLLs and Naming Conventions

**Function Naming Conventions**
- Windows Functions that have been updated significantly have Ex appended to their names (e.g. CreateWindowEx)
- Functions that take strings as parameters append a A or W at the end of their names (e.g. CreateDirectoryW)
##### Exported Functions
DLLs and EXEs can export functions to be used by other programs. The PE file contains information about which functions a file exports.
In Microsoft's documentation, in order to run a program as a service you should define a `ServiceMain` function. Meaning, if a malware has an exported function called `ServiceMain` it means that it runs as part of a service.

Export information can also be viewed in **Dependency Walker**.
